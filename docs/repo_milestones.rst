Milestones
==========

I have milestones named after months of the year, followed by the year itself.
This helps me to get my work done as soon as possible, aiming to hit the milestones that I add
to the issue/PR. It also gives you an indication of when your issue/PR will be merged.

If the milestone ``February 2020`` was added to your issue/PR, that means I want to get this
implemented or merged BEFORE March 2020.

**Failing to meet milestone deadlines**

In the event that I fail to implement or merge the issue/pr to a sufficient level 
before the deadline ends, you will receive one of two labels:

* Status: Lamented
* Status: Rejected

I have failed to meet the deadline for the following reasons:

1. I'm not 100% certain about this PR/Issue.
2. The requested changes could change the functionality of the cog.
3. I'm very busy and don't have a lot of time to review your issue/PR.
4. The requested changes are complicated, and has therefore taken too long to complete.

If I no longer want to work on the issue/PR, I will simply add the ``Status: Rejected`` label.
If I want to continue work on this issue/PR, I will add the ``Status: Lamented`` label. This
basically means it will be moved back to the ``To do`` project section until I am ready to start
actively working on the issue/PR.
